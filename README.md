# What is go-instabot?

The easiest way to boost your Instagram account and get likes and followers.

Go-instabot automates **following** users, **liking** pictures, **commenting**, and **unfollowing** people that don't follow you back on Instagram.

![Instabot demo gif](/docs/instabot.gif)

### Concept
The idea behind the script is that when you like, follow, or comment something, it will draw the user's attention back to your own account. There's a hidden convention in Instagram, that will make people follow you back, as a way of saying "thank you" I guess.
Moreover, you may have noticed that when you follow someone, Instagram tells you about 'similar people to follow'. The more active you are on Instagram, the more likely you are to be in this section.

## How to run
This is it!
Since you used the `go get` command, you now have the `go-instabot` executable available from anywhere* in your system. Just launch it in a terminal :

`go-instabot`

**\*** : *You will need to have a folder named 'config' (with a 'config.json' file) in the directory where you launch it.*

### Options
**-h** : Use this option to display the list of options.

**-config** : Path to config file. config/config.json by default.

**-logs** : Use this option to enable the logfile. The script will continue writing everything on the screen, but it will also write it in a .log file.

**-nomail** : Use this option to disable the email notifications.

**-sync** : Use this option to unfollow users that don't follow you back. Don't worry, the script will ask before actually doing it, so you can use it just to check the number!

**-noduplicate** : Use this to skip following, liking and commenting same user in this session!

### Tips
- If you want to launch a long session, and you're afraid of closing the terminal, I recommend using the command __screen__.
- If you have a Raspberry Pi, a web server, or anything similar, you can run the script on it (again, use screen).
- To maximize your chances of getting new followers, don't spam! If you follow too many people, you will become irrelevant.

  Also, try to use hashtags related to your own account : if you are a portrait photographer and you suddenly start following a thousand #cats related accounts, I doubt it will bring you back a thousand new followers...
  
Good luck getting new followers!
